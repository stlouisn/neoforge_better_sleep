Minecraft mod for the [Fabric mod loader](https://www.fabricmc.net/). 
Inspired as the counterpart to [Sneak Through Berries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneakthroughberries)!

Mojang might, but I don't!

Makes it so that you take damage on magma blocks even while sneaking. 

Can also optionally make you take damage on magma blocks even while wearing Frostwalker-enchanted boots.

Configure options either through [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) or by editing `.minecraft/config/no_sneaking_over_magma.json`. 

If you'd like to translate No Sneaking Over Magma! (there are only a few lines of text), follow [this link](https://crowdin.com/project/no-sneaking-over-magma/invite). New translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).

This mod is only for Fabric and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it.

I'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required.
