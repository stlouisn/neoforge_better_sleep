Minecraft mod for the Fabric modloader. 
Inspired as the counterpart to [Sneak Through Berries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneakthroughberries)!
> ~~Why Mojang lets you sneak on literal magma but not through bushes... idk~~

Mojang might, but I don't!

Makes it so that you take damage on magma blocks even while sneaking. 

Can also optionally make you take damage on magma blocks even while wearing Frostwalker-enchanted boots.

Configure options either through [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)'s config menu or by editing `.minecraft/config/no_sneaking_over_magma.json`. 

This mod is only for Fabric and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license isÂ [MIT](https://will-lucic.mit-license.org/), however, so anyone else is free to port it.

I'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required.
