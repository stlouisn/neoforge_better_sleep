Mojang might, but I don't!

Makes it so that you take damage on magma blocks even while sneaking. 

Can also optionally make you take damage on magma blocks even while wearing Frostwalker-enchanted boots.

Configure options either by editing `.minecraft/config/no_sneaking_over_magma.json`,
or through ModMenu's config menu if you have ModMenu installed.
